<b>Description:</b><br />
Matthew Del Fante and Molli Drivdahl (Team (MD)^2) will be collaborating together to make an animated music video by the end of the term. The music video will be made from scratch to go along with the song "My House" by Flo Rida. The idea of the music video is that Matt, Molli and Flo Rida are giving house tours of their dream houses throughout the music video.

<b>Technologies:</b><br />
C++, Qt, QML, Javascript <br />

<b>Installation Instructions:</b><br />
1.  Install Qt 5.6 <br \>
2.  Open project <br \>
3.  Clean all, run qmake, build all, run. <br \>

<b>Contribution Guidelines:</b><br />
Throughout the term, Molli Drivdahl and Matt Del Fante will work on the music video equally until the end of the term. For any future contributors to the project after the end of the term, development changes can be made by branching code (we think, we are still novices to git), editing code for different parts of the project, and merging the code back to git after reviewing the changes made (again, we think).

<i>Note on naming convention:</i><br />
We preface all aliases with 2 letter identifiers that distinguish its type followed by an underscore.
We preface c++ data members with an "m_" followed by the data member name.
We will develop a more extensive naming convention in the near future.

<b>Bugs, ToDo List and Revision History:</b><br />
<i>Bugs:</i></b><br />
1. Changing the size of the window as any animations are happening causes undefined behavior. <br />
2. Opening the music video project (after clicking the green arrow) takes longer then most people would expect. <br />

<i>ToDo List:</i></b><br />
1. Update the read me screen shots. <br />

<i>Revision History:</i></b><br />
1. Completed the first chorus of the song. <br />
2. Fixed timer bug where timers worked differently on different machines. <br />
3. Implemented more anchors to ensure the music video would look good for any sized screen. <br /> 
4. Finished the second verse of the song. <br />
5. Finished the second chorus of the song. <br />
6. Finished the third verse of the song. <br />
7. Finished the third chorus of the song. <br />
8. Added credits to the end of the music video. <br />
9. Added a volume slider to the settings menu. <br />
10. Reduced build times exponentially. <br />
11. Added audio to the splash screen and credits. <br />
12. Added a volume slider to the music video. <br />
13. Added "Exit After Credits" setting and functionality (works like loop play when disabled). <br />
14. Synched all music video animations correctly to the music. <br />
15. Fixed champagne scene's "immediate popping" bug. <br />
16. Fixed bug so that the music video is always in synch with the song even when only building once. <br />

<i>Things That Could Not Be Done Due To Time Constraints:</i></b><br />
1. Adding play/pause and setting buttons to the music video. <br />
2. Adding a functioning subtitles button that would display the song's lyrics with the music video. <br />

<b>Inspiration:</b><br />
For Matt, the idea to make an animated music video came from the animated start menu of the example project "Bishop's Fianchetto" shown on the first day of the GUI course. For Molli, the idea came from a previous Adobe Flash project from high school involving creating animations to go along with a song. We picked My House by Flo Rida since it is catchy and we thought we could express our selves easily and in a fun manner via house tours.<br />
