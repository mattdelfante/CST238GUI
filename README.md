<b>Description:</b><br />
Matthew Del Fante and Molli Drivdahl (Team (MD)^2) will be collaborating together to make an animated music video by the end of the term. The music video will be made from scratch to go along with the song "My House" by Flo Rida. As of right now, the idea is that the music video will be of Matt and Molli giving house tours of their dream houses to the music video.

<b>Technologies:</b><br />
C++, Qt, QML, Javascript <br />

An animation of a champagne bottle popping will happen when the song sings "Open up the champagne...Pop!" at the start of the song to kick off the beginning of the music video.

This is how the beginning of the house tour aspect of the music video begins.

<b>Installation Instructions:</b><br />
1.  Install Qt 5.6 <br \>
2.  Open project <br \>
3.  Clean all, run qmake, build all, run. <br \>

<b>Contribution Guidelines:</b><br />
Throughout the term, Molli Drivdahl and Matt Del Fante will work on the music video equally until the end of the term. For any future contributors to the project after the end of the term, development changes can be made by branching code (we think, we are still novices to git), editing code for different parts of the project, and merging the code back to git after reviewing the changes made (again, we think).

<i>Note on naming convention:</i><br />
We preface all aliases with 2 letter identifiers that distinguish its type followed by an underscore.
We preface c++ data members with an "m_" followed by the data member name.
We will develop a more extensive naming convention in the near future.

<b>Bugs and ToDo List:</b><br />
Audio for the song "My House" will not play in the program, even though other audio files will play.<br />
Dragging of the champagne bottle is a little shaky with occasional weird behavior.<br />
The champange bottle gif begins the first frame prematurely upon releasing the object.<br />
Eventually the project should be a fully functioning animated music video matched to the song "My House" by Flo Rida that incorporates many GUI components.<br />

<b>Inspiration:</b><br />
For Matt, the idea to make an animated music video came from the animated start menu of the example project "Bishop's Fianchetto" shown on the first day of the GUI course. For Molli, the idea came from a previous Adobe Flash project from high school involving creating animations to go along with a song. We picked My House by Flo Rida since it is catchy and we thought we could express our selves easily and in a fun manner via house tours.<br />
